# ProofVault

Everything you own, with the proof that protects you.

## Open in Xcode
1. Open Xcode.
2. Choose **File → Open...**
3. Select the `PrroofVault` project folder.

## Verification
Run the verification script before finishing work:

```sh
./tool/verify.sh
```

## What “M0” Means
M0 is pipeline/scaffold only. No feature work, no UI changes—just the repo operating system needed for future, verifiable changes.
